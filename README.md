Hospital Management System Overview

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Java-based console application designed to manage key operations of a hospital. This system facilitates the management of patients, staff, appointments, and departments, streamlining healthcare operations and ensuring smooth workflow across different hospital sections. Using JDBC, the system communicates with a relational database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

This repository provides the source code for a simple yet comprehensive hospital management system, which is implemented using Java and JDBC for database interaction. Features

    Patient Management

    Create New Patient: Add new patients with essential details (name, address, phone number, gender, and date of birth). View Patient Information: Retrieve detailed information about a patient by name. Update Patient Information: Modify patient details such as phone number, address, and date of birth. Delete Patient: Remove a patient's record from the system.

    Staff Management

    Create New Staff: Add new hospital staff (e.g., doctors, nurses, receptionists) with personal information and department details. View Staff Information: Retrieve detailed information about a staff member by name. Update Staff Information: Modify staff details like department, phone number, and personal information. Delete Staff: Remove a staff member from the system.

    Department Management

    Create Department: Add new departments (e.g., Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Medical). Delete Department: Remove a department from the system. View All Departments: List all available hospital departments.

    Appointment Management

    Add Appointment: Schedule a patient's appointment with a specific staff member. Update Appointment: Modify appointment details such as status or date/time. View Appointments: Display all appointments and their statuses.

Technologies Used

Java: The main programming language used to build the system.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Used for database connection and executing SQL queries.
MySQL / PostgreSQL: A relational database used to store and manage hospital data.
SQL: For creating and manipulating database tables and records.

Installation Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK 8 or higher on your system.
Database Setup:
    You will need to set up a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
    Create a database and run the necessary SQL scripts to create the required tables (patient, staff, department, appointment).
